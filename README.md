# Linky-Snake

This project is a simple implementation of Snake game. The goal of the game is to get the highest possible score, by eating the little apple that rabdomly pops out in the game field. In order to move snake use the arrows in the keyboard. The game will end both if the snake eats its own tail and if it crashes against one of the "walls".
